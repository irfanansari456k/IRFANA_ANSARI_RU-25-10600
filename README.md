**📝 Project Title**

Online Food Order Simulation System (C Language)

📖 Project Description

This project is developed using C programming language to simulate an Online Food Ordering System.
The program displays a food menu, takes quantity input from the user, and calculates the total bill using functions.
It helps in understanding the practical use of arrays, loops, and functions in C.
